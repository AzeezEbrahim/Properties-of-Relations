**Properties of Relations** - *Version 1.0.0*

A (binary) relation R between sets X and Y is a subset of X×Y.  (X×Y is a Cartesian product.) 

It have the following properties:
- Reflexivity
- Irreflexivity
- Symmetry
- Antisymmetry
- Asymmetry
- Transitivity

This is a program that implements a binary relation property test using java language, it made to help students to test multiple properties easily.

# How to use
There are four 
- Relation_of_properties_GUI --> It has the program in jar, and it also has the sorce code of the GUI
- Relation_of_properties_TestBench --> it has the java code only with a testbench, can be tested in any editor 
- FlowChart --> it has a simple flowchrt of the algorithm 
- AlternativesMethods --> it is just an alternative algorithm on some of the code to test the efficiency (it might has some errors)
