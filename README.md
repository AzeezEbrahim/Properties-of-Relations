# Introduction

This program aims to help the students in the **relation's properites** topic, it allows to test multiple properties easily.

# Properties of Relations 
A (binary) relation R between sets X and Y is a subset of X×Y.  (X×Y is a Cartesian product.) 

#### The program cover the following properties:
- Reflexivity
- Irreflexivity
- Symmetry
- Antisymmetry
- Asymmetry
- Transitivity
- Equivalency

# How to use
There are four Folders:
- Relation_of_properties_GUI Folder
  - It has the program in jar, and it also has the source code of the GUI
- Relation_of_properties_TestBench Folder
  - It has the java code only with a testbench, can be tested using eclipse
- FlowChart Folder
  - It has a simple flowchrt of the algorithm 
- AlternativesMethods Folder
  - It is just an alternative algorithm on some of the code to test the efficiency (it might has some errors)
