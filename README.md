# Introduction
A (binary) relation R between sets X and Y is a subset of X×Y.  (X×Y is a Cartesian product.) 
It have the following properties:
1- Reflexivity
2- Irreflexivity
3- Symmetry
4- Antisymmetry
5- Asymmetry
6- Transitivity

# How to use
There are four files in this project
1- Relation_of_properties_GUI --> It has the program in jar and exe, and it also has the sorce code of the GUI
2- Relation_of_properties_TestBench --> it has the java code only with a testbench, can be tested in any editor 
3- FlowChart --> it has a simple flowchrt of the algorithm 
4- AlternativesMethods --> it is just an alternative algorithm on some of the code to test the efficiency (it might has some errors)
